"""Tone generator for Pygame Zero.

This tone generator is a wrapper for pyfxr, a custom Cython library for sound
generation. Tones are kept in a LRU cache which in typical applications
will reduce the number of times they need to be regenerated.

To minimise the extent that pauses affect gameplay, the ``play()`` function
offloads tone generation to a separate thread. Because tones are generated
with numpy operations this should allow at least part of this work to happen
on another CPU core, if present.
