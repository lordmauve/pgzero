Installing Pygame Zero
======================

On desktop systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install pgzero

This will also install Pygame. Pre-compiled Pygame packages are available to pip
for Windows & Linux (32-bit and 64-bit), and for Mac OS (64-bit only). If you
have a different system, you'll need to find a way to install pygame first.

On Raspberry Pi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pgzero has been installed by default since the release of Raspbian Jessie in
September 2015!
