Welcome to Pygame Zero
======================

Pygame Zero is for creating games without boilerplate.

It is intended for use in education, so that teachers can teach basic
programming without needing to explain the Pygame API or write an event loop.

        If you're ready to try writing a full game, an event to look out for is
        PyWeek_, which happens twice a year at https://pyweek.org/.

        It's an online game programming challenge: you have a week to write a
        game in Python, using Pygame Zero or other libraries. Lots of other
        people will be writing games too, and you can watch their progress and
        play and rate the finished results after the competition.
