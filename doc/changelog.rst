1.2 - 2018-02-24
----------------

* New: :ref:`Actors can be rotated <rotation>` by assigning to ``actor.angle``
* New: Actors now have :meth:`~Actor.angle_to()` and
  :meth:`~Actor.distance_to()` methods.
* New: Actors are no longer subclasses of Rect, though they provide the same
  methods/properties. However they are now provided with floating point
  precision.
* New: ``tone.play()`` function to allow playing musical notes.
* New: ``pgzrun.go()`` to allow running Pygame Zero from an IDE (see
  :doc:`ide-mode`).
* New: show joypad icon by default
* Examples: add Asteroids example game (thanks to Ian Salmons)
* Examples: add Flappy Bird example game
* Examples: add Tetra example game (thanks to David Bern)
* Docs: Add a logo, fonts and colours to the documentation.
* Docs: Documentation for the :ref:`anchor point system for Actors <anchor>`
* Docs: Add :doc:`from-scratch` documentation
* Fix: ``on_mouse_move()`` did not correctly handle the ``buttons`` parameter.
* Fix: Error message when resource not found incorrectly named last extension
  searched.
* Fix: Drawing wrapped text would cause crashes.
* Fix: :func:`animate()` now replaces animations of the same property, rather
  than creating two animations which fight.
* Updated ptext to a revision as of 2016-11-17.
* Removed: removed undocumented British English ``centrex``, ``centrey``,
  ``centre`` attribute aliases on ZRect (because they are not Rect-compatible).

1.1 - 2015-08-03
----------------

* Added a spell checker that will point out hook or parameter names that have
  been misspelled when the program starts.
* New ZRect built-in class, API compatible with Rect, but which accepts
  coordinates with floating point precision.
* Refactor of built-in ``keyboard`` object to fix attribute case consistency.
  This also allows querying key state by ``keys`` constants, eg.
  ``keyboard[keys.LEFT]``.
* Provide much better information when sound files are in an unsupported
  format.
* ``screen.blit()`` now accepts an image name string as well as a Surface
  object, for consistency with Actor.
* Fixed a bug with non-focusable windows and other event bugs when running in
  a virtualenv on Mac OS X.
* Actor can now be positioned by any of its border points (eg. ``topleft``,
  ``midright``) directly in the constructor.
* Added additional example games in the ``examples/`` directory.

1.0.2 - 2015-06-04
------------------

* Fix: ensure compatibility with Python 3.2

1.0.1 - 2015-05-31
------------------

This is a bugfix release.

* Fix: Actor is now positioned to the top left of the window if ``pos`` is
  unspecified, rather than appearing partially off-screen.

* Fix: repeating clock events can now unschedule/reschedule themselves

  Previously a callback that tried to unschedule itself would have had no
  effect, because after the callback returns it was rescheduled by the clock.

  This applies also to ``schedule_unique``.

* Fix: runner now correctly displays tracebacks from user code

* New: Eliminate redraws when nothing has changed

  Redraws will now happen only if:

      * The screen has not yet been drawn
      * You have defined an update() function
      * An input event has been fired
      * The clock has dispatched an event


1.0 - 2015-05-29
----------------

* New: Added ``anchor`` parameter to Actor, offering control over where its
  ``pos`` attribute refers to. By default it now refers to the center.

* New: Added Ctrl-Q/âŒ˜-Q as a hard-coded keyboard shortcut to exit a game.

* New: ``on_mouse_*`` and ``on_key_*`` receive ``IntEnum`` values as ``button``
  and ``key`` parameters, respectively. This simplifies debugging and enables
  usage like::

        if button is button.LEFT:


1.0beta1 - 2015-05-19
---------------------

Initial public (preview) release.
